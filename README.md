## Introduction

An exploratory data analysis was completed to look at what factors contribute to certain college football teams winning more than others.

## Data

College football data was collected for the 2019 football season and combined with recruiting data from the 2015-2019 seasons.  Metrics included:

-Points Scored
-Points Allowed
-Offense Success Rate
-Defense Success Rate
-Wins
-Five Year Recruting Ranking

## Methodology

Several EDA techniques were used, including basic descriptive statistics, PMF, CDF and Normal Probability Plot. In addition, some basic statistical analysis was done on the data, including correlations and a regression analysis.

## Findings

The amount of points scored (or given up) had highest impact on winning.  Recruiting rankings were also significant, but only when looking at defense.  Further analysis is needed to see if there conference differences that impact the metrics.
